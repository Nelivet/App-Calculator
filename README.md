# App Calculator IOS

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Calculator app for iOS. This app is an example of how to create a calculator using Swift and Xcode.
The layout is created and we use horizontal stack views nested within a vertical stack view to create a nice grid for all the buttons on our calculator.

Use a simple expression to do the work of math operations. An alert dialog box is also created for the user indicating if they have entries that cannot be calculated and rounding the results of our calculator to decimals.
